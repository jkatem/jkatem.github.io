I have been in this coding bootcamp for about a month already, and it is already VERY challenging! I find that this challenge correlates to many aspects of my life, or life in general, whenever someone is opening themselves up to something new. It is a lot like being back in school, and trust me, I was never good a being a student in school. Many of the obstacles I remember back then is coming up now, and it is like I'm re-learning how to learn and retain information. Definitely having trouble with being in the mindset of learning, especially when I have so many other "life" factors that I didn't have to have in college.
