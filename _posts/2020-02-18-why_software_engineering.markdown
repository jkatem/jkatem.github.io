I've been thinking about switching my career to Software Engineer for a long time. The obstacles that comes with it is daunting, and in the end, you may not even make it. Knowing the challenges and hardships that will come with learning Software Engineering without any prior knowledge is actually what pushes me to do it. I enjoy the challenge, and I think it is a wonderful area to be in today, with all the technological advances that is happening everyday. I hope that my success will make an impact on the world.
